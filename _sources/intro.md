# Welcome!

Hello, my name is Dante. I'm a machine learning engineer who also happens to be the CEO of an e-commerce company, a lawyer, a Jorge Luis Borges scholar (*cfr*. my book [*Oh tiempo tus pirámides*](https://www.amazon.com/Oh-tiempo-tus-pirámides-ensayos-ebook/dp/B08K3QGZTM/)), a former professional Halo player (*cfr*. [my latest stats](https://halotracker.com/halo-infinite/profile/xbl/Magnustein/overview)) and an African-American music, Austrian economics, behavioral biology, philosophical materialism, chess and mixed martial arts aficionado.

This is the place where I share new insights about the things that I love.

Check out some of my essays:
