# Ensayos | Dantis Elementorum

The name of this blog is inspired by Euclid's Elements, since I intend to write about what I consider the most fundamental elements of the fields that I'm interested in. Sections are:

* **ELEMENTORUM PHYSICÆ MATHEMATICÆ**. Where I mainly discuss technical stuff related to STEM disciplines.
* **ELEMENTORUM IURISPRUDENTIÆ POLITICÆ ŒCONOMICÆ**. Where I mainly discuss topics related to law, economics and politics.
* **ELEMENTORUM POETICÆ**. Where I mainly discuss literary things.
* **ELEMENTORUM PHILOSOPHIÆ**. Where I mainly discuss my philosophical views.
* **EXAGIUM**. Where I write uncategorized intuitions *a vuelapluma*.
