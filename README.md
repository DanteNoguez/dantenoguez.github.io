# Ensayos | Dantis Elementorum

The name of this blog is inspired by Euclid's Elements, since I intend to write about what I consider the most fundamental elements of the fields that I'm interested in. Sections are:

* **ELEMENTORUM PHYSICÆ MATHEMATICÆ**. Where I mainly discuss technical stuff related to STEM disciplines.
* **ELEMENTORUM IURISPRUDENTIÆ POLITICÆ ŒCONOMICÆ**. Where I mainly discuss topics related to law, economics and politics.
* **ELEMENTORUM POETICÆ**. Where I mainly discuss literary things.
* **ELEMENTORUM PHILOSOPHIÆ**. Where I mainly discuss my philosophical views.
* **EXAGIUM**. Where I write uncategorized intuitions *a vuelapluma*.

## Work in progress

- [ ] Add discussion about software 2.0 to chaper III of *Elementos de programación*.
- [ ] In relation to *Elementos de redes neuronales*, explain how the weights work and why we use them; explain what the loss function is and how it connects to the network.
- [x] Add explanatory text to *El Hacedor*.
- [x] Add explanatory text to *El Hacedor 2.0*. Implement the paper [Bengio et. al, 2003](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf).
- [ ] Make *Hacedor* and *Hacedor 2.0* prettier.
- [ ] Write *Elementos arquitectónicos de un modelo transformer*. Implement [*Attention is all you need*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) and explain each component/layer/mechanism.
- [ ] Write *Elementos de teoría computacional*. Implement and explain a simple Turing machine based on [the paper](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Turing_Paper_1936.pdf).
- [ ] Write *Elementos de aritmética*. Implement and explain the Peano axioms.
- [ ] Fix and complete *Elementos de leyes*. Change to a more technical style, add more legal theory, explain contractual theory, explain relation between property and economics based on Menger. Appendix about Areopagitica.
- [ ] Write *Elementos genealógicos de Bitcoin*. Trace back the economic theory from which Bitcoin emerged: Menger $\to$ Vera C. Smith $\to$ Hayek $\to$ Selgin and White $\to$ Szabo, Finney and Wei. Add appendix related to the political and economical principles of Bitcoin, review Álvaro D. María's books. Relate decentralization to programming and AI.
- [ ] Complete *Elementos terminológicos* and *Elementos de música afroamericana*.
- [ ] Write *Contra el escepticismo*. Explain why modern scepticism is a very basic fallacious philosophy.
- [ ] Write *Elementos de biología conductual*. I will probably focus on energy, motivation and reproduction.
- [ ] Implement and explain an AI music generator and a Latin translator.
